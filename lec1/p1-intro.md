---

## Preliminary Knowledge
### Principles of computer composition
  - :( Mr. Liu/Mr. Kang's RISC-V principle
  - :) Patterson's RISC-V Principles

### Compilation principle
  - :) It doesn't affect much if you haven't learned it
  - :( But you still need to know the high level language <â€“>RISC-V assembly language

## Curriculum Design (Big experiment)

### Various operating system related functions and extensions

- OS porting on various CPU platforms
   * RISC-V, x86-64, MIPS, ARM
- Driver development for various development boards
   * RaspBerry PI, U740, D1, etc.
   * GUI, driver, file system, network
- Perfection and improvement of the operating system kernel module
   * Kernel loadable modules, microkernels
   * Introduce asynchronous programming in the kernel

## Grade Evaluation

### Choice 1:
   - Complete experiment 1-5 on time: 30%
   - Midterm exam 30% + final exam 40% : 70%
### Choice 2:
   - Complete experiment 1-5 within four weeks (2022 spring experiment): 30%
   - Curriculum design (i.e., big experiment): 70%
     - Note: Students who choose the big experiment need to take the exam if they quit the course design later.
